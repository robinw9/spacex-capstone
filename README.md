# SpaceX Capstone Project 🚀

This repository contains the final project for the SpaceX Capstone (Applied Data Science).

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for each stage:
  - Data Collection (API + Wikipedia)
  - Data Wrangling & Cleaning
  - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
  - SQL Queries
  - Folium Maps
  - Plotly Dash Dashboard
  - Predictive Analysis (Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN)
- `scripts/` – Python helper scripts for data analysis and visualization
- `presentation/` – Final presentation in PDF format
- `data/` – Processed CSV files (if any, small only)
- `README.md` – Project summary

## 🔍 Project Summary
The project explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Build visualizations and interactive dashboards
- Use SQL to query structured launch data
- Map launch sites using Folium
- Build and evaluate predictive models for landing success

## 📊 Results
- Decision Tree accuracy: ~83%
- SVM (RBF) accuracy: ~80%
- Logistic Regression: ~79%
- KNN: ~75%
